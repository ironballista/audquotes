It is a miracle for any two like-minded people to meet within the chaotic flux...
That's why forging bonds and relationships is a source of happiness.
That is the root cause of... the joys of being alive...
It's not a cold, but a warm kind of sorrow... Shining more brightly as a result of its limits...
