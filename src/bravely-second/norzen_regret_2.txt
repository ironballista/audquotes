As brave men and women fought for their own beliefs, their own sense of justiceâ€”I sat here in my office, unsure as to which side to lend my strength.
In doing nothing, I brought only greater tragedy. I will not repeat my mistake!
This time, I will trust my own sense of justice. I will take action!
